      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        TitleFixer is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This
        Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard
        your information when you visit our website or use our services.
      </p>
      <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when
        you use our services, including when you make a purchase or sign up for
        an account. This information may include your name, email address,
        shipping address, payment information (such as credit card numbers), and
        any other information you choose to provide.
      </p>
      <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>We may use the information we collect from you to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Process and fulfill your orders</li>
        <li>Provide customer service and support</li>
        <li>Communicate with you about your orders and account</li>
        <li>Personalize your experience on our website</li>
        <li>Improve our products and services</li>
        <li>Detect, prevent, and address technical issues</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Payment Information</h3>
      <p>
        When you make a purchase on our website, your payment is processed
        through a secure third-party payment processor. We do not store or have
        access to your credit card information. The payment processor collects
        and processes your payment information securely in accordance with
        industry standards.
      </p>
      <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        We may use third-party services to help us operate our business and the
        website or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending out
        newsletters or surveys. We may share your information with these third
        parties for those limited purposes provided that you have given us your
        permission.
      </p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from
        loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
        destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or
        electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute
        security.
      </p>
      <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time.
